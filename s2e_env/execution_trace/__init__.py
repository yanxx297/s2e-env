class ExecutionTraceParser:
    """
    Parser for S2E execution trace files.

    The parsing algorithm is described below. Note that "state" and "path" are
    used interchangably (the term "state" is used in the S2E code base, however
    a state is essentially an execution path through a program).

    If S2E is run in multiprocess mode, each process will create and write to
    its own ``ExecutionTracer.dat`` file. So first we parse each
    ``ExecutionTracer.dat`` file individually.

    While parsing we maintain a global (i.e. across all trace files) map of
    state IDs to parent state ID and fork points (the ``_path_info``
    attribute). This map is then used to reconstruct the final execution tree
    once all traces have been parsed.

    Take the following execution tree, where ``Sx`` refers to a state ID with
    ID ``x``:

    .. code-block::

        S0
        |
        S0
        |
        S0
        | \
        S0 S1
        |  |
        S0 S1
        .  | \
        .  S1 S2
        .  |  |
        .  .  .

    After parsing the ``ExecutionTracer.dat`` file(s) the ``_execution_traces``
    map will look as follows:

    .. code-block::

        _execution_traces = {
            0: [S0_0, S0_1, S0_2, S0_3, S0_4, ...],
            1: [S1_0, S1_1, S1_2, ...],
            2: [S2_0, ...],
        }

    We iterate over ``_execution_traces`` from the highest state ID (i.e. the
    state that was forked last) to the lowest (state 0, the initial state).

    For each execution trace, its parent and fork point is looked up in
    ``_path_info``. In this example, S2's parent is S1 and fork point is 1
    (because the fork occurred at index 1 of the S1 execution trace list).
    Because the fork point is at 1, we know that the ``TraceItemEntry`` at
    index 1 is a ``TraceFork`` object. We then take the S2 execution trace list
    and insert it into the ``TraceFork``'s ``children`` attribute.

    Repeating the process for S1, we get parent state S0 and fork point 2
    (because the fork occurred at index 2 of the S0 execution trace list). Once
    again we can insert the S1 list into the ``children`` attribute at this
    fork point.

    Finally, we terminate because S0 has no parent. The entire execution tree
    is now stored in the S0 execution trace list.

    Now assume that the user is only interested in S1. During the initial file
    parsing phase, we can assume that any state > 1 is forked after S1 is
    forked and hence is of no interest. Therefore we do not need to store the
    data associated with these states.

    During the construction of the final tree, we can further discard
    information that is no longer required. For example, after S0 forks S1, we
    are no longer interested in the remainder of S0 (i.e. elements ``[S0_3,
    S0_4, ...]`` in ``_execution_traces[0]``). Likewise if the user is only
    interested in S2, then all of the trace entries that follow S2's fork point
    (i.e. ``[S1_2, ...]``) and S1's fork point (i.e. ``[S0_3, S0_4, ...]``) can
    be discarded.

    Attributes:
        _trace_files: A list of ``ExecutionTracer.dat`` file paths.
        _execution_traces: A dictionary of state IDs to the execution trace (a
                           list of ``(TraceItemHeader, TraceEntry)`` tuples).
        _path_info: A map of state IDs to a tuple containing:
                        1. The parent state's ID
                        2. A "fork point". This is an index into state ID's
                           trace in the ``_execution_traces`` dictionary. This
                           index points to to a ``TraceFork`` object and hence
                           where a fork occurred.
